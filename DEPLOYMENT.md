# 🚀 Railway Deployment Guide

## Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

### Option 1: Direct Railway Connect
1. Go to [Railway](https://railway.app)
2. Connect GitHub repository: `Bogdan099/bogdan-release-tools`
3. Railway will automatically detect `railway.json` config
4. Deploy will start automatically

### Option 2: Railway CLI
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login with token
railway login --token 865b4851-d367-4c12-89dd-9d04ae397529

# Deploy
railway up
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Railway Token
✅ **ALREADY CONFIGURED** in GitHub Secrets as `RAILWAY_TOKEN`

### Files Created:
- ✅ `railway.json` - Railway deployment configuration
- ✅ `web_api.py` - Web server with REST API  
- ✅ `version_manager.py` - Core functionality
- ✅ `.github/workflows/railway-deploy.yml` - CI/CD pipeline

## 🌐 API Endpoints (After Deployment)

Once deployed, your Railway app will provide:

- **`GET /`** - Web interface
- **`GET /api/version`** - Get current version
- **`GET /api/bump?type=patch`** - Increment version  
- **`GET /api/validate?version=1.0.0`** - Validate version
- **`GET /health`** - Health check

## 📊 Expected Deployment URL

Railway will provide a URL like:
- `https://bogdan-release-tools-production.up.railway.app/`
- `https://web-production-XXXX.up.railway.app/`

## ✅ Verification Steps

After deployment:

1. **Health Check**: `GET /health`
   ```json
   {
     "status": "healthy",
     "service": "version-manager-api", 
     "current_version": "1.1.0"
   }
   ```

2. **Version API**: `GET /api/version`
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "version": "1.1.0",
     "info": {...}
   }
   ```

3. **Web Interface**: Visit base URL for interactive interface
