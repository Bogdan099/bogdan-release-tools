# Requirements for Version Manager
# Semantic Versioning tool for Python projects

# No external dependencies required - uses only Python standard library:
# - re (regex for version validation)
# - json (for version file storage)
# - os (for file operations)
# - pathlib (for file path handling)
# - enum (for bump type enumeration)
# - datetime (for metadata timestamps)
# - argparse (for CLI interface)

# Optional dependencies for development/testing:
# pytest>=7.0.0  # For unit testing
# pytest-cov>=4.0.0  # For test coverage
